This should output a graphical progress indicator to the terminal.\n\n**Challenge:** Figuring out how to quantify progress is non-trivial since:\n- Steps can run in parallel\n- Steps can expand/contract the number of items (flatMap/reduce)\n\n**Next step:** Design a strategy for measuring progress before implementing the indicator.\n\n**Use case:** Particularly useful for batch workflows like embed-documents.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"jeff@jeffutter.com","created_at":"2026-01-18T12:21:59.663074086-06:00","created_by":"Jeffery Utter","updated_at":"2026-01-18T12:24:47.83583006-06:00"}

{"id":"rag3.0-t6x","title":"Investigate duplicate embedding code","description":"There appears to be duplication between two embedding-related files:\n\n1. **src/lib/embeddings.ts** - Utility function `generateEmbeddings()`\n   - Handles batch processing (multiple texts in single API call)\n   - Full Zod schema validation\n   - Sorts results by index\n   - Verifies response count matches input count\n\n2. **src/retrieval/embedding.ts** - Pipeline step `createEmbeddingStep()`\n   - Processes single text at a time\n   - Uses type assertion instead of Zod\n   - Has retry configuration\n   - Integrates with pipeline infrastructure\n\n**Task:** Determine if these are truly duplicates or serve different purposes. If duplicates, remove the one that's less aligned with the codebase architecture (likely consolidate into the utility function and have the step use it).","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"jeff@jeffutter.com","created_at":"2026-01-18T12:29:32.187432406-06:00","created_by":"Jeffery Utter","updated_at":"2026-01-18T12:30:32.37946173-06:00"}
